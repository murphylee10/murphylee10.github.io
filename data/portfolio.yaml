about:
    description: |
        Hi there! I'm a highly motivated and driven Computer Science undergraduate at Nanyang Technological University.
        I love to design and build user-centric software that is both functional and beautiful.
        I believe that technology has the potential to make the world a better place, and I am passionate about creating practical and meaningful solutions to the problems we face in everyday life. As Steve Jobs said, "Technology is nothing. What's important is that you have faith in people, that they're basically good and smart — and if you give them tools, they'll do wonderful things with them."
        Besides my passion in technology, I am also an avid reader of Wuxia (Martial Heroes) novels, and regularly jog to help manage stress and find enjoyment in this fast-paced and competitive city.

experience:

      title: AWS Developer, Intern
      description: |
          As an AWS Developer Intern at Toyota Canada, I implemented VPCs and a serverless architecture using API Gateway, Lambda, and CloudFormation, which led to a 20% reduction in infrastructure costs and improved application performance. 
          I also developed automated testing frameworks using Elastic Beanstalk, CodePipeline, and CodeDeploy, resulting in a 60% reduction in testing time and a 30% increase in test coverage. 
          Additionally, I utilized over 15 AWS services to create interactive Cost Intelligence Dashboards, optimizing expenses and reducing Toyota’s AWS billing by over 5%.
