  description: |
    Hi there! I'm Murphy, a Software Engineer and Computer Science Specialist at UofT. 
    I'm passionate about building software that is functional, scalable, and user-friendly. 
    I have experience working with a variety of technologies such as Angular, Node, and Postgres, but I'm always eager to explore new tools and frameworks. 
    I also love to dance, and in the past I've competed at national competitions and worked in multiple Netflix films.
    Check out my resume or get in touch if you'd like to learn more about me!
